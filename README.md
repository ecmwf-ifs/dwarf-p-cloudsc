## Licence

`dwarf-p-cloudsc` is distributed under the Apache Licence Version 2.0. See
[LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

## Prototypes available

- **dwarf-P-cloudMicrophysics-IFSScheme**: The original cloud scheme
  from IFS that is naturally suited to host-type machines and
  optimized on the Cray system at ECMWF.
- **dwarf-cloudsc-fortran**: A cleaned up version of the CLOUDSC
  prototype that validates runs against platform and language-agnostic
  off-line reference data via HDF5 or the Serialbox package. The kernel code
  also is slightly cleaner than the original version.
- **dwarf-cloudsc-c**: Standalone C version of the kernel that has
  been generated by ECMWF tools. This relies exclusively on the Serialbox
  validation mechanism.
- **dwarf-cloudsc-gpu-kernels**: GPU-enabled version of the CLOUDSC dwarf
  that uses OpenACC and relies on the `!$acc kernels` directive to offload
  the computational kernel.
- **dwarf-cloudsc-gpu-claw**: GPU-enabled and optimized version of CLOUDSC
  that is based on an auto-generated version of CLOUDSC based on the CLAW
  tool. The kernel in this demonstrator has been further optimized with
  gang-level loop blocking to demonstrate potential performance gains.
- **dwarf-cloudsc-gpu-scc**: GPU-enabled and optimized version of
  CLOUDSC that utilises the native blocked IFS memory layout via a
  "single-column coalesced" (SCC) loop layout. Here the outer NPROMA
  block loop is mapped to the OpenACC "gang" level and the kernel uses
  an inverted loop-nest where the outer horizontal loop is mapped to
  OpenACC " vector" parallelism. This variant lets the CUDA runtime
  manage temporary arrays and needs a large `PGI_ACC_CUDA_HEAPSIZE`
  (eg. `PGI_ACC_CUDA_HEAPSIZE=8GB` for 160K columns.)
- **dwarf-cloudsc-gpu-scc-hoist**: GPU-enabled and optimized version of
  CLOUDSC that also uses the SCC loop layout, but promotes the inner
  "vector" loop to the driver and declares the kernel as sequential.
  The block array arguments are fully dimensioned though, and
  multi-dimensional temporaries have been declared explicitly at the
  driver level.

## Download and Installation

The code is written in Fortran 2003 and it has been tested using the various compilers, including:

    GCC 7.3, 9.3, 11.2
    Cray 8.7.7
    NVHPC 20.9
    Intel (classic)

This application does not need MPI nor BLAS libraries for performance. Just a compiler that understands
OpenMP directives. Fortran must be at least level F2003.

Inside the dwarf directory you can find some example of outputs inside the example-outputs/ directory.

In addition, to run the dwarf it is necessary to use an input file that can be found inside the config-files/
directory winthin the dwarf folder.

The preferred method to install the CLOUDSC dwarf uses the bundle
definition shipped in the main repository. For this please
install the bundle via:

```sh
./cloudsc-bundle create  # Checks out dependency packages
./cloudsc-bundle build [--build-type=debug|bit|release] [--arch=./arch/ecmwf/machine/compiler/version]
```

The individual prototype variants of the dwarf are managed as ECBuild features
and can be enable or disabled via `--cloudsc-<feature>=[ON|OFF]` arguments to
`cloudsc-bundle build`.

The use of the `boost` library or module is required by the Serialbox
utility package for filesystem utilities. If `boost` is not available
on a given system, Serialbox's internal "experimental filesystem" can
be used via the `--serialbox-experimental=ON` argument, although this
has proven difficult with certain compiler toolchains.

### GPU versions of CLOUDSC

The GPU-enabled versions of the dwarf are by default disabled. To
enable them use the `--with-gpu` flag. For example to build on the in-house
volta machine:

```sh
./cloudsc-bundle create  # Checks out dependency packages
./cloudsc-bundle build --clean --with-gpu --arch=./arch/ecmwf/volta/nvhpc/20.9
```

### MPI-enabled versions of CLOUDSC

Optionally, dwarf-cloudsc-fortran and the GPU versions can be built with
MPI support by providing the `--with-mpi` flag. For example on volta:

```sh
./cloudsc-bundle create
./cloudsc-bundle build --clean --with-mpi --with-gpu --arch=./arch/ecmwf/volta/nvhpc/20.9
```

Running with MPI parallelization distributes the columns of the working set
among all ranks. The specified number of OpenMP threads is then spawned on
each rank. Results are gathered from all ranks and reported for the global
working set. Performance numbers are also gathered and reported per thread,
per rank and total.

**Important:** If the total size of the working set (2nd argument, see
"[Running and testing](#running-and-testing)") **exceeds** the number of
columns in the input file (the input data in the repository consists of just
100 columns), every rank derives its working set by replicating the columns in
the input file, starting with the first column in the file. This means, all
ranks effectively work on the same data set.
If the total size of the working set is **less than or equal** to the number of
columns in the input file, these are truly distributed and every rank ends up
with a different working set.

When running with multiple GPUs each rank needs to be assigned a different
device. This can be achieved using the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment
variable:

```sh
mpirun -np 2 bash -c "CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=\${OMPI_COMM_WORLD_RANK} bin/dwarf-cloudsc-gpu-claw 1 163840 8192"
```

### Choosing between HDF5 and Serialbox input file format

The default build configuration relies on HDF5 input and reference data for
dwarf-cloudsc-fortran as well as GPU and Loki versions. The original
dwarf-P-cloudMicrophysics-IFSScheme always uses raw Fortran binary format.

**Please note:** The HDF55 installation needs to have the f03 interfaces installed (default with HDF5 1.10+).

As an alternative to HDF5, the [Serialbox](https://github.com/GridTools/serialbox)
library can be used to load input and reference data. This, however, requires
certain boost libraries or its own internal experimental filesystem, both of
which proved difficult on certain compiler toolchains or more exotic hardware
architectures.

The original input is provided as raw Fortran binary in prototype1, but
input and reference data can be regenerated from this variant by running

```sh
CLOUDSC_WRITE_INPUT=1 ./bin/dwarf-P-cloudMicrophysics-IFSScheme 1 100 100
CLOUDSC_WRITE_REFERENCE=1 ./bin/dwarf-P-cloudMicrophysics-IFSScheme 1 100 100
```

Note that this is only available via Serialbox at the moment. Updates to HDF5
input or reference data have to be done via manual conversion. A small
Python script for this with usage instructions can be found in the
[serialbox2hdf5](serialbox2hdf5/README.md) directory.

### Building on ECMWF's Atos BullSequana XH2000

To build on ECMWF's Atos BullSequana XH2000 supercomputer, run the following commands:

```sh
./cloudsc-bundle create
./cloudsc-bundle build --arch arch/ecmwf/hpc2020/compiler/version [--single-precision] [--with-mpi]
```

Currently available `compiler/version` selections are:

* `gnu/9.3.0` and `gnu/11.2.0`
* `intel/2021.4.0`
* `nvhpc/22.1` (use with `--with-gpu` on AC's GPU partition)

### A64FX version of CLOUDSC

Preliminary results for CLOUDSC have been generated for A64FX CPUs on
Isambard. A set of arch and toolchain files and detailed installation
and run instructions are provided
[here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/~nabr/3rd+Isambard+Hackathon).

## Running and testing

The different prototype variants of the dwarf create different binaries that
all behave similarly. The basic three arguments define (in this order):

- Number of OpenMP threads
- Size of overall working set in columns
- Block size (NPROMA) in columns

An example:

```sh
cd build
./bin/dwarf-P-cloudMicrophysics-IFSScheme 4 16384 32  # The original
./bin/dwarf-cloudsc-fortran 4 16384 32   # The cleaned-up Fortran
./bin/dwarf-cloudsc-c 4 16384 32   # The standalone C version
```

### Running on ECMWF's Atos BullSequana XH2000

On the Atos system, a high-watermark run on a single socket can be performed as follows:

```sh
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=64
OMP_PLACES="{$(seq -s '},{' 0 $(($OMP_NUM_THREADS-1)) )}" srun -q np --ntasks=1 --hint=nomultithread --cpus-per-task=$OMP_NUM_THREADS ./bin/dwarf-cloudsc-fortran $OMP_NUM_THREADS 163840 32
```

For a double-precision build with the GNU 11.2.0 compiler, performance of
~73 GF/s is achieved.

To run the GPU variant on AC, which includes some GPU nodes, allocate
an interactive session on a GPU node and run the binary as usual:

```sh
srun -N1 -q ng -p gpu --gres=gpu:4 --mem 200G --pty /bin/bash
bin/dwarf-cloudsc-gpu-scc-hoist 1 262144 128
```

For a double-precision build with NVHPC 22.1, performance of ~340 GF/s
on a single GPU is achieved.

A multi-GPU run requires MPI (build with `--with-mpi`) with a dedicated MPI
task for each GPU and (at the moment) manually assigning CUDA devices to each
rank, as Slurm is not yet fully configured for the GPU partition.

To use four GPUs on one node, allocate the relevant resources
```sh
salloc -N 1 --tasks-per-node 4 -q ng -p gpu --gres=gpu:4 --mem 200G
```

and then run the binary like this:

```sh
srun bash -c "CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=\$SLURM_LOCALID bin/dwarf-cloudsc-gpu-scc-hoist 1 \$((\$SLURM_NPROCS*262144)) 128"
```

In principle, the same should work for multi-node execution (`-N 2`, `-N 4` etc.) once interconnect issues are resolved.

## Loki transformations for CLOUDSC

Loki is an in-house developed source-to-source translation tool that
allows us to create bespoke transformations for the IFS to target and
experiment with emerging HPC architectures and programming models. We
use the CLOUDSC dwarf as a demonstrator for targeted transformation
capabilities of physics and grid point computations kernels, including
conversion to C and GPU via downstream tools like CLAW.

To use the Loki demonstrators, Loki and CLAW need to be installed as
described in the
[Loki install instructions](https://git.ecmwf.int/projects/RDX/repos/loki/browse/INSTALL.md).
*Please note that the in-house "volta" machine needs some manual workarounds for this atm.*

Once Loki and CLAW are installed and activated via `source loki-activate`,
the following build flags enable the demonstrator build targets:

```sh
# For general use on workstations with GNU
# Please note that OpenACC needs to be disable with GNU,
# since CLAW-generated code currently does not comply with GNU.
./cloudsc-bundle build --clean --with-loki --loki-frontend=fp --arch=./arch/ecmwf/leap42/gnu/7.3.0

# For GPU exploration on volta
./cloudsc-bundle build --clean [--with-gpu]--with-loki --loki-frontend=fp --arch=./arch/ecmwf/volta/nvhpc/20.9
```

The following Loki modes are included in the dwarf, each with a bespoke demonstrator build:

- **cloudsc-loki-idem**: "Idempotence" mode that performs a full
  parse-unparse cycle of the kernel and performs various housekeeping
  transformations, including the driver-level source injection
  mechanism currently facilitated by Loki.
- **cloudsc-loki-sca**: Pure single-column mode that strips all horizontal
  vector loops from the kernel and introduces an outer "column-loop"
  at the driver level.
- **cloudsc-loki-claw-cpu**: Same as SCA, but also adds the necessary CLAW
  annotations. The resulting cloudsc.claw.F90 file is then processed
  by CLAW to re-insert vector loops for optimal CPU execution.
- **cloudsc-loki-claw-gpu**: Creates the same CLAW-ready kernel file, but
  triggers the GPU-specific optimizations in the CLAW compiler to
  insert OpenACC-offload instructions in the driver and an OpenACC
  parallel loop inside the kernel for each block. This needs to be run
  with large block sizes (eg. NPROMA=1024-8192).
- **cloudsc-loki-c**: A prototype C transpilation pipeline that converts
  the kernel to C and calls it via iso_c_bindings interfaces from the
  driver.

### A note on frontends

Loki currently supports three frontends to parse the Fortran source code:

- [FParser](https://github.com/stfc/fparser) (`loki-frontend=fp`):
  The preferred default; developed by STFC for PsyClone.
- [OMNI](https://github.com/omni-compiler/omni-compiler) frontend (`loki-frontend=omni`):
  Generates the same AST as used by CLAW.
- [OFP](https://github.com/OpenFortranProject/open-fortran-parser),
  a Python wrapper around the ROSE frontend (`loki-frontend=ofp`):
  Supported, but bugged in some places and slow; use with care.

For completeness, all three frontends are tested in our CI, which
means we require the `.xmod` module description files for utility
routines in `src/common` for processing the CLOUDSC source files with
the OMNI frontend. These are stored in the source under
`src/cloudsc_loki/xmod`.
